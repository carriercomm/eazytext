EastText
========

Wiki, in general is a simple markup language to generate html pages
that can be rendered in a browser. This is quick and neat way of 
documentation.

EazyText is a text markup that is primarily developed for Zeta Project
Collaboration suite, visit `discoverzeta <http://www.discoverzeta.com/>`_

The Browser and its HTML are built for documentation. Wiki makes
it accessible. As a newbie, get started with EazyText in 5 minutes.  As a pro,
