* Document style-shortcut for font-size.

* Instrument runtime.py to capture text that is processed as `str` instead of
  unicode. Document the rational behind every string->unicode conversion.

* ``nested`` etxconfig should mean that no article tag or paragraph tag to be
  generated. Instead define a different config parameter to generate
  article.etblk

* Generate anchor for heading using CSS. Once this is done, make sure that it
  is consistent with eazyslides TOC and TOC macro.

* Launchpad-eazytext project details have several links to external sites
  related to eazytext, fill them up.

* Send out a mail specifying that the <br> is new and wiki-properties are
  removed.

* HTML 5 tags that are relevant to eazytext.
    article,    aside,  audio,  button, caption,    details/summary
    embed,  header, footer, meter,  del,    ins,    strike, time,
    nav,    progress,   section,    source,     audio/video,
    figure, figcaption, mark,   meter

* Should <article> tag be wrapped around nested etx-text ?

* parser.restart() and lex.restart() doesnot seem to be sufficient, for now
  avoiding reuse of parser and lexer objects. Find a long term solution.
  Nested and Frontpage extensions can benefit from parser/lexer re-use.

* parse() appends a newline at the end of the wiki text, prune them while
  dump()
