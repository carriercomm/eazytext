* Convert Style shortcuts into plugins.

* TTags for generating <q> does not display quotes when integrated with
  pluggdapps.com. Standalone tests seem to work proper.

* Launchpad-eazytext project details have several links to external sites
  related to eazytext, fill them up.

* HTML 5 tags that are relevant to eazytext.
    article,    aside,  audio,  button, caption,    details/summary
    embed,  header, footer, meter,  del,    ins,    strike, time,
    nav,    progress,   section,    source,     audio/video,
    figure, figcaption, mark,   meter

* parser.restart() and lex.restart() doesnot seem to be sufficient, for now
  avoiding reuse of parser and lexer objects. Find a long term solution.
  Nested and Frontpage extensions can benefit from parser/lexer re-use.

* parse() appends a newline at the end of the wiki text, prune them while
  dump()

* Empty tag elements must be self closing. Make sure that all generated html
  with empty tags are self closing. This seem to have some problems. What is the
  right way of doing ?
