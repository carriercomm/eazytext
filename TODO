* Generate anchor for heading using CSS. Once this is done, make sure that it
  is consistent with eazyslides TOC and TOC macro.

* Launchpad-eazytext project details have several links to external sites
  related to eazytext, fill them up.

* Send out a mail specifying that the <br> is new and wiki-properties are
  removed.

* HTML 5 tags that are relevant to eazytext.
    article,    aside,  audio,  button, caption,    details/summary
    embed,  header, footer, meter,  del,    ins,    strike, time,
    nav,    progress,   section,    source,     audio/video,
    figure, figcaption, mark,   meter

* Should <article> tag be wrapped around nested etx-text ?

* parser.restart() and lex.restart() doesnot seem to be sufficient, for now
  avoiding reuse of parser and lexer objects. Find a long term solution.
  Nested and Frontpage extensions can benefit from parser/lexer re-use.

* parse() appends a newline at the end of the wiki text, prune them while
  dump()

* Empty tag elements must be self closing. Make sure that all generated html
  with empty tags are self closing.

* Nested tags of the form
    ``{----} xx-small size ``{+} larger size`` ``
  must be supported. While detecting the closing markup check for the presence 
  if style shortcut. If it is present then consider it as opening markup.

* Add syntax highlighting for <br>

* Self-closing tags for <a> element inside h[1-6] heading causes problem.
