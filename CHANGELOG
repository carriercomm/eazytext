h3. 0.9beta

Making first public release, as open-source tool under BSD license. Available
from python package index at, http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zwiki-zeta/0.9beta

* ZWiki features and enhancements
   ** Alternative markup for headers,
      [<PRE     h1. h2. h3. h4. h5. >]
   ** Added tag template for `addr` tag-type.
   ** Wiki extension added for code blocks.
   ** Email obfuscation.
   ** Footnote feature.
   ** Added zeta-links for wiki and revision.
   ** Added tag template for `quotable quotes`

* ZWiki bug fixes
   ** Refined wiki styling in `wiki properties`, `style parameter` to macros.
   ** When invalid macro text is present, instead of leaving the Content
      object's text empty, fill it with empty space. Otherwise
      processcontents() will try to process the macro object.
   ** Multi-line support added for big tables.
   ** Style shortcuts added for ordered and un-ordered lists.
   ** Fixes to Heading anchor points.
   ** Isolate errors in ZWiki extension property text and handle them

h3. 0.82dev

* ZWiki features and enhancements
   ** Multiline support for list item.
   ** Multiline support for definition item.
   ** Multiline support for html text with HTML markup [< ... >]
   ** Templated tags.

* ZWiki bug fixes
   ** 'www' uri is automatically converted to http://www. ... form
   ** Documentation for macros, templated tags, zwiki-extensions
   ** Macro object is converted to html during parsing time, instead of in
      tohtml() phase, since BQuotes object simply collects the html content.
   ** Toc() macro's tohtml() was returning an empty string. This leads the
      framework to think that there was no html. All the post-html processing
      macros should return a ' ' to avoid this anomaly.
   ** Optional spaces and tabs are allowed before head-markup
